MVP
    - wait for particle to hit before moving on, character movement
        - Freeze controls?
    - flag capturing
    - game over logic.
    - ParticleSystem for heal.
    - Distinct graphic for missile vs grenade.
        - shotgun vs normal bullet?
    - level selector - unlock one at a time.

- AI
    - Freeze projectiles before animations
        - use AnimationState in characters AND projectiles.
    - Need flag logic
    - Projectile target prediction (figure ricochets ahead of time).
    - Start using GameState struct.
    - Make select character, character state into Actions?


        const isTargetACharacter = (target: Target) => {
            return this.redSquad.concat(this.blueSquad)
                .find((character) =>
                    character.tileCoords.equals(target.tile)) != null;
        };


Make every render size in terms of Grid.TILE_SIZE
so it's easy to resize.

Use indices instead of isBlueTeam - allows for >2 teams in the future.

Things to experiment with:
- destructible obstacles
- Fog of war
- pickups
- To respawn, or not to respawn.
- Teleport pads
- classic explosive barrels

Level creation:
- Symmetry option (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)
- Set name
- Grid dimensions

Things to copy to template:
- Theme
- closePath on grid lines
- particle system
- update math & ui libs
