Refactoring/Cleanup
    - action type to available action types, control abstractions
    - serialize game state, keep track
    - use gameState only?
        - use animations on top of gameState?
    - Make every render size in terms of Grid.TILE_SIZE
        so it's easy to resize.

MVP features
    - wait for particle to hit before moving on, character movement
        - Freeze controls?
    - Can quit/reset upon game over.
    - Redo level selection ui
    - Campaign mode?
        - unlock one at a time, AI has bigger squad

AI improvements:
    - Use heals/grenades.
    - Aim random +X%

Things to experiment with:
    - Fog of war
    - To respawn, or not to respawn.
    - engineers that can turn on turrets
        - or secure new spawners.
    - destructible obstacles
        - classic explosive barrels
    - pickups
    - Teleport pads

Level creation:
    - Symmetry option (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)
    - Set name
    - Grid dimensions

Things to copy to template:
    - Theme
    - Grid search/path algs
    - particle system
    - update math & ui libs
